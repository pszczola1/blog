# Just a simple blog website in django

This is my first bigger project in python. When making this I concentrated on backend side, so the website itself may not look too good(I'm terrible at styling).


## Features
- registration/login system
- commenting(adding and deleting)
- integration with [Quill.js](https://quilljs.com)
- responsive(kinda)


## Todo
- deleting and banning accounts
- profile pictures in comment section
- like button under a post
- hashtags and filtering posts by them


### Used packages
- Django(4.1.6)
- Pillow
- Django REST Framework
- [django-quill-editor](https://pypi.org/project/django-quill-editor/)
- [django-crispy-forms](https://pypi.org/project/django-crispy-forms/)
- [crispy-bootstrap5](https://pypi.org/project/crispy-bootstrap5/)
